# Good Manners Assistant üé©üçΩÔ∏è

A knowledgeable etiquette chatbot powered by Emily Post's ETIQUETTE (17th Edition) by Peggy Post.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Hugging Face's Inference API, Gradio, and FAISS for efficient similarity search. The chatbot, named "Good Manners Assistant," is designed to provide helpful advice on etiquette, social norms, and proper behavior in various situations, based on Emily Post's renowned guide to modern manners.

## Features

- Uses the Zephyr-7b-beta model from Hugging Face for natural language processing
- Implements RAG to provide context-aware responses
- Utilizes FAISS for efficient similarity search in the knowledge base
- Provides example prompts to demonstrate the chatbot's capabilities
- Offers a user-friendly interface powered by Gradio

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- A Hugging Face account (sign up at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/join))

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NavdeepKaur4368528/good-manners-assistant.git
   cd good-manners-assistant
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the PDF of Emily Post's ETIQUETTE (17th Edition) and place it in the project directory with the filename `emily_post_etiquette.pdf`.

## Usage

To run the chatbot locally:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open your web browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).

## How It Works

1. The chatbot loads the PDF of Emily Post's ETIQUETTE and processes it into a vector database.
2. When a user asks a question, the system searches for relevant passages in the etiquette guide.
3. The retrieved context is then passed to the LLM along with the user's query.
4. The LLM generates a response based on the provided context and its training.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the following in `app.py`:

- Knowledge base: Replace `emily_post_etiquette.pdf` with another PDF to change the chatbot's knowledge domain.
- System message: Edit the `system_message` variable to adjust the chatbot's behavior and tone.
- Model: Change the `InferenceClient` to use a different model from Hugging Face.
- Examples: Modify the `examples` list to showcase different interactions.
